            <p>
                In Mini Comics (WEBMYDIG), we pay great attention to your private information. We hope you will understand how <strong>Mini Comics (WEBMYDIG)</strong> uses your information while using WEBMYDIG services. Therefore, we hope you will take the time to read the following policy carefully.
            </p>

            <h2>Information collected or received from you</h2>
            <p>
                We collect and process basic information for running our business and provide our service to you. You can usually choose what information you want to provide, but in some cases we need to require some certain information which help not only you use but also us provide service.
            </p>
            <p>
                We collect or receive information in a few different ways, depending on what services you use and how you use them:
            </p>

            <h3>1. Information provided by you</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Identification information:</strong> For example, your email address, username, and authentication credentials used to sign up or log in.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Information collected from the service you use</h3>
            <p>
                We collect information about you and the devices you use to access the service, such as your computer, mobile phone, or tablet. The information that we collect includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Device information:</strong>
                    <p>We may collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms?hl=en#toc-terms-unique-device-id" target="_blank">unique device identifiers</a>, and mobile network information including phone number). WEBMYDIG may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your WEBMYDIG user account.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Log information:</strong>
                    <p>When you use our services or view content provided on the service, we may automatically collect and store certain information in <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms?hl=en#toc-terms-server-logs" target="_blank">server logs</a>. This may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Details of how you used our service, such as your search queries, reading history, bookmarks, and transaction history;</li>
                        <li><p>Internet <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms?hl=en#toc-terms-ip" target="_blank">protocol (IP) address</a></p></li>
                        <li>Device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL;</li>
                        <li><p><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms?hl=en#toc-terms-cookie" target="_blank">Cookies</a> that may uniquely identify your browser or your WEBMYDIG user account.</p></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Location information:</strong> When you use a location-enabled device, we may collect and process information about your approximate location, like the GPS signals sent by a mobile device. We may also use various technologies to determine approximate location, such as sensor data from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points and cell towers, for advertising, analytics, or to protect access to content that is geo-locked due to regional licensing restrictions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Unique application numbers:</strong> Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to WEBMYDIG when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic or required updates.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Local storage:</strong> We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cookies and <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy/key-terms?hl=en#toc-terms-identifier" target="_blank">anonymous identifiers</a>:</strong> We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit our services, and this may include sending one or more cookies or anonymous identifiers to your device. We also use cookies and anonymous identifiers when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or WEBMYDIG features that may appear on other sites.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Information from Third Parties</h3>
            <p>
                Some members or visitors may choose to connect to WEBMYDIG or register a WEBMYDIG account by using an external third-party application, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google. Connecting your WEBMYDIG account to third-party applications or services is optional. If you choose to connect your account to a third-party application, WEBMYDIG may receive information from that application and use it as part of providing our Services to you. For example:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Account creation and authentication:</strong> If you sign up for a WEBMYDIG account using Facebook, Twitter, or Google, we receive your email address, photo, and other public profile information, which is then used to create your WEBMYDIG profile and subsequent log in authentication.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Your choices</h2>
            <p>
                People have different personal privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices about how it is used.
            </p>
            <p>Here are some of your choices related to personal privacy:</p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                <li>You can provide, edit, or remove certain information from your public profile by editing your profile. You may also change or correct your private WEBMYDIG account information through your account settings.</li>
                <li>Many of our Services let you choose to share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines such as Google or Bing.</li>
                <li>If you no longer wish to use the Services or receive service-related communications (except for legally required notices), then you may delete your account. You can contact us by Email to delete your account. Our Email address: <a href="mailto:support@webmydig.com">support@webmydig.com</a></li>
                <li>Be aware that any personal information that you choose to share in public spaces such as comments or profile walls can be read, collected, or used by others, or could be used to send unsolicited messages to you. WEBMYDIG generally does not remove content from public spaces, so some of your posts or comments may remain public even after your account is deleted, though your name and profile photo will no longer be displayed alongside any posts. You are responsible for the personal information that you choose to post in public spaces through the Services.</li>
                <li>If your personal information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to remove it — unless we are required to retain that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your request.</li>
                <li>Where we can provide information access and correction, we will do so for free, except where it would require a disproportionate effort. We aim to maintain our services in a manner that protects information from accidental or malicious destruction. Because of this, after you delete information from our services, we may not immediately delete residual copies from our active servers and may not remove information from our backup systems. Please note that we may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes).</li>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
                Your personal information is important to you, and protecting that information is important to us. We take reasonable measures to protect WEBMYDIG and our users from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or loss of information we hold, including administrative, technical, and physical safeguards.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your account information is protected by a password. It is important that you protect against unauthorized access to your account and information by choosing your password carefully and by keeping your password and device secure, such as by logging out after using the Services.
            </p>
            <p>
                We follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and after it is received. Here are some of the security measures we take:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: decimal;">
                <li>We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to guard against unauthorized access to systems.</li>
                <li>We restrict access to personal information to WEBMYDIG employees, contractors, and agents who need to know that information in order to process it for us, and who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security of the transmission or storage of your information.

            <h2>About children</h2>
            <p>
                Our service is not applicable to anyone under 13 years of age. We have graded our application according to the Iarcservices grading system standard. Children under 13 years of age please do not use WEBMYDIG. In addition, for users younger than 18 years old, we will restrict your access to some content through Mature Content Filter. If your country or district requires parental consent to be able to use this service, we will ask for parental consent and authorization.
